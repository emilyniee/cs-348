# cs-348 milestone-3

## Starting the application

### env file
Please create a .env file until milestone-2 with the following contents
```
POSTGRES_DB=mydb
POSTGRES_USER=myuser
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://myuser:mypassword@db:5432/mydb
```

### docker
Run `docker-compose up`, and everything should be ready to go!

## Viewing the application
To view the web based application, visit http://localhost:3000/

Requests can be made to the backend at http://localhost:8000/

To view the database, you can access PgAdmin at http://localhost:5050
Use email admin@admin.com and password pgadmin to sign in.

## Production Dataset
The production dataset is generated by running the scripts in the `backend/data_processing_scripts` directory. 

These scripts scrape and download raw data from basketball-reference.com using the `basketball_reference_web_scraper` API and `NBA.com` API. 

The processed data is saved as CSV files in the `backend/data` folder. 

The database schema is set up with the `create_tables.sql` (located in `backend/sql_queries`), and the data is populated into PostgreSQL using the populate function in `database.py`.
